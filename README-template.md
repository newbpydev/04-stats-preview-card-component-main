## Overview

This is my solution to the Stat preview card component. I added a few extra
features to make the desktop version a little more pleasant.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learned on this project that it is easy to get lost on which layout would
be best to use, I have tried both flexbox and grid to see which would be easier
to maintain later on. I have also tried the mobile-first approach and work my
way to the desktop version.

```css
.main-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;

  min-width: max-content;
}
```

### Continued development

For future development, I will continue to train using the flexbox and combine
it with the grid.

### Useful resources

- [YouTube @media tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRtI1MIjhs&ab_channel=ThuNghiem) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understanding the @media
  for mobile and the importance of creating a more responsive site.

The code may not be perfect compared to my sensei @jonasschmedtman but I need
to thank him because he has shown me the ropes and now I am a confident web
designer.
